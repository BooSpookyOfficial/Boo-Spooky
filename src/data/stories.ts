      "Okay, so picture this: I'm at the pharaoh's funeral, right? And I thought it would be hilarious to crack a joke about him 'wrapping up' his reign. Yeah, turns out ancient Egyptian priests have zero sense of humor.",
      "Next thing I know, I'm cursed for all eternity. And here's the kicker - being dead somehow made my jokes even worse. Now I'm stuck making terrible puns, and literally nobody wants to hear them. My dating life is... well, non-existent."

      "I thought maybe I could make some money off it, so I tried filming it for TikTok. But the manifestations are absolutely terrible at performing. Like, worse than a dad at a wedding terrible. Plus they keep getting tangled in power lines and I have to go sort them out at 3 AM. The neighbors think I'm weird."

      "But you know what? Instead of giving up, I learned sign language. Now I volunteer there every day helping people find books. Turns out you can still be helpful even when you're dead. Plus, the librarian makes amazing coffee and doesn't judge my terrible jokes."

      "The tour guide kept butchering my life story, so I started whispering corrections from the shadows. Now people think it's this amazing 'interactive tour.' Little do they know it's just me being annoyed and correcting the record. At least I'm getting good Yelp reviews."

      "If you want to hear more of my ridiculous adventures, follow me on Twitter @boospooky_! I post new stories all the time, plus random thoughts about being dead in the modern world. Fair warning though - my tweets are just as bad as my real-life jokes.",
