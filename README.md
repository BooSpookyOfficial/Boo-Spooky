## Technical Implementation

The website is built using modern web development technologies to ensure optimal performance, accessibility, and user experience across all devices and platforms.

### Technology Stack

- **React 18** - Component-based architecture for maintainable and scalable development
- **TypeScript** - Static type checking for improved code quality and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for consistent and responsive design
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server for efficient workflow
- **Lucide React** - Comprehensive icon library for consistent visual elements

### Architecture Features

The application follows modern React patterns with functional components and hooks. The design system implements a cohesive color palette centered around dark themes with strategic red accents to maintain visual consistency throughout the user experience.

The responsive design ensures optimal viewing across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Each story is presented with carefully considered typography and layout variations to maintain reader engagement while preserving accessibility standards.

## Design Philosophy

The visual design balances atmospheric elements with readability and user experience. The color scheme employs dark backgrounds with high-contrast text to create an immersive environment while ensuring content accessibility.
